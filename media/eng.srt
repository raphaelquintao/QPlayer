1
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,555
Christmas comes but once a year

2
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,893
For every girl and boy

3
00:01:10,976 --> 00:01:15,232
The laughter and the joy

4
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:19,735
They find in each new toy

5
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,240
I'll tell you of a little boy

6
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:28,746
Who lives across the way

7
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,166
This little fella's Christmas

8
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,547
Is just another day

9
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,065
It was just before dawn

10
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:13,777
One miserable morning

11
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,821
In black '44

12
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:23,495
When the forward commander
was told to sit tight

13
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:27,500
When he asked that
his men be withdrawn

14
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:33,465
And the generals gave thanks

15
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:35,468
As the other ranks

16
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,971
Held back the enemy tanks

17
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:41,013
For a while

18
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,598
And the Anzio bridgehead

19
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,186
Was held for the price

20
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,441
Of a few hundred ordinary lives

21
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:18,098
He's the little boy

22
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:25,105
That Santa Claus forgot

23
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:27,440
And Goodness knows

24
00:04:27,523 --> 00:04:32,695
He didn't want a lot

25
00:04:34,364 --> 00:04:38,117
He sent a note to Santa

26
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,124
For some soldiers and a drum

27
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:46,753
It broke his little heart

28
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:51,425
When he found Santa hadn't come

29
00:04:52,218 --> 00:04:54,720
In the street he envies

30
00:04:54,804 --> 00:04:58,974
All those lucky boys

31
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:30,096
So ya thought ya

32
00:07:30,138 --> 00:07:32,099
Might like to

33
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:34,101
Go to the show

34
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,402
To feel the warm thrill
of confusion

35
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:44,654
That space cadet glow

36
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:51,161
Tell me, is something
eluding you, sunshine

37
00:07:51,244 --> 00:07:55,583
Is this not what
you expected to see

38
00:07:55,666 --> 00:08:00,464
If you wanna find out
what's behind these cold eyes

39
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:05,677
You'll just have to
claw your way through this disguise

40
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:35,633
Mama loves her baby

41
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:41,306
And Daddy loves you too

42
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:47,729
And the sea may look
warm to you, babe

43
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:52,359
And the sky may look blue

44
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:58,031
Ooh, ooh, ooh

45
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,200
Ooh, babe

46
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:08,753
Ooh, ooh, ooh

47
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:12,003
Baby blue

48
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:21,016
Ooh, ooh, ooh

49
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:25,187
Ooh, ooh, babe

50
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:31,568
If you should go skating

51
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:34,654
On the thin ice of modern life

52
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,994
Dragging behind you

53
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:42,496
The silent reproach

54
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:46,792
Of a million tear-stained eyes

55
00:11:48,462 --> 00:11:50,464
Don't be surprised

56
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:53,717
When a crack in the ice

57
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,346
Appears under your feet

58
00:11:58,765 --> 00:12:04,229
You slip out of your depth
and out of your mind

59
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:08,148
With you fear
flowing out behind you

60
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:10,778
As you claw the thin ice

61
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:14,806
Daddy's flown across the ocean

62
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,150
Leaving just a memory

63
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:33,659
A snapshot in the family album

64
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:44,671
Daddy, what else
did you leave for me

65
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:54,474
Daddy, what'd ya leave behind for me

66
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:01,314
All in all it was

67
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:04,442
Just a brick in the wall

68
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:14,038
All in all it was all
just bricks in the wall

69
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:38,814
Easy. Be careful.

70
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:52,121
- What?
- Will you put me on there?

71
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:55,164
- Well, where's your mother, then?
- She's gone to the shops.

72
00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:57,250
Yes, all right.

73
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:01,922
How's that then? Enjoying it?

74
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,305
Lovely, lovely.

75
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:23,194
Now off you go.
Go on.

76
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:27,242
Now what have I told you about this?
What have I told you?

77
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:31,162
Go on, go on now. Sling your hook.
Go on. Sling your hook.

78
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:34,881
And kind old King George

79
00:17:34,964 --> 00:17:37,800
Sent Mother a note

80
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:40,596
When he heard that Father was gone

81
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:46,016
It was, I recall

82
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,145
In the form of a scroll

83
00:17:49,229 --> 00:17:51,356
Gold leaf and all

84
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,322
And I found it one day

85
00:17:57,405 --> 00:18:00,699
In a drawer of old photographs

86
00:18:00,782 --> 00:18:02,702
Hidden away

87
00:18:04,787 --> 00:18:08,751
And my eyes still grow damp
to remember

88
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:11,669
His Majesty signed

89
00:18:11,753 --> 00:18:14,507
With his own rubber stamp

90
00:18:17,218 --> 00:18:19,845
It was dark all around

91
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:22,431
There was frost in the ground

92
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:25,643
When the tigers broke free

93
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,192
And no one survived

94
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:36,532
From the Royal Fusiliers Company C

95
00:18:39,657 --> 00:18:42,912
They were all left behind

96
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,665
Most of them dead

97
00:18:45,748 --> 00:18:49,753
The rest of them dying

98
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,843
And that's how the high command

99
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:58,680
Took my daddy from me

100
00:19:59,454 --> 00:20:03,918
Did you see the frightened ones

101
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:08,214
Did you hear the falling bombs

102
00:20:08,297 --> 00:20:12,885
Did you ever wonder why
we had to run for shelter

103
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:18,599
When the promise of a brave new world
unfurled beneath the clear blue sky

104
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:38,997
Did you see the frightened ones

105
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:43,503
Did you hear the falling bombs

106
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:48,674
The flames are all long gone
but the pain lingers on

107
00:20:52,302 --> 00:20:54,304
Good-bye

108
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:56,851
Blue sky

109
00:20:56,934 --> 00:21:00,395
Good-bye, blue sky

110
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:02,399
Good-bye

111
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:06,818
Good-bye

112
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:16,538
Wait for me, Pinky,
you rotten bleeder.

113
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:19,543
- They're my bullets, ain't they?
- I don't know.

114
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:23,004
Come on, Tubs.
It's great down in the tunnel.

115
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:25,422
Don't you think
it'd be dangerous, Pinky?

116
00:21:25,505 --> 00:21:27,299
No. Don't be daft.

117
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,524
- You all right, Tubs?
- Yeah. Hurt me knee a bit.

118
00:21:49,573 --> 00:21:51,241
- Come on.
- Na. It's too dangerous.

119
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:54,245
- We'll wait for the train.
- Give me the torch.

120
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:06,885
Pinky! Here comes the train!

121
00:22:06,968 --> 00:22:09,471
Get off the line,
you bloody idiot! Here it comes!

122
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:15,353
Pinky, get off the line!
Here it comes!

123
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:17,562
Pinky, get off the line!

124
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:37,001
You!

125
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:43,508
You! Yes, you!

126
00:22:43,591 --> 00:22:45,425
Stand still, laddie!

127
00:23:08,493 --> 00:23:11,372
When we grew up and went to school

128
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:16,917
There were certain teachers who would
hurt the children anyway they could

129
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:24,927
By pouring their derision
upon anything we did

130
00:23:25,011 --> 00:23:27,306
Exposing every weakness

131
00:23:27,347 --> 00:23:31,060
However carefully hidden
by the kids

132
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:33,563
What have we here, laddie?

133
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:36,856
Mysterious scribblings?
A secret code?

134
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:40,443
No. Poems, no less.

135
00:23:40,526 --> 00:23:42,655
Poems, everybody!

136
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:44,908
The lad here reckons himself
a poet.

137
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:49,162
"Money, get back.
I'm all right, Jack.

138
00:23:49,204 --> 00:23:52,416
Keep your hands
off my stack.

139
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,752
New car, caviar,
four-star daydream.

140
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:59,007
Think I'll buy me
a football team. "

141
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:01,675
Absolute rubbish, laddie!

142
00:24:01,717 --> 00:24:05,013
Get on with your work.

143
00:24:05,096 --> 00:24:06,723
Repeat after me:

144
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:10,019
An acre is the area
of a rectangle...

145
00:24:10,061 --> 00:24:12,356
whose length is one furlong...

146
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:15,189
and whose width is one chain.

147
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:17,526
But in this town it was well known

148
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:21,906
When they got home at night
their fat and psychopathic wives

149
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:25,284
Would thrash them
within inches of their lives

150
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:48,561
We don't need no education

151
00:24:53,273 --> 00:24:57,778
We don't need no thought control

152
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:07,039
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

153
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,422
Teacher, leave them kids alone

154
00:25:22,181 --> 00:25:26,518
Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone

155
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:35,945
All in all it's just
another brick in the wall

156
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,699
Wrong! Do it again!

157
00:25:39,782 --> 00:25:45,456
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall

158
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,297
We don't need no education

159
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:56,300
If you don't eat your meat,
you can't have any pudding!

160
00:25:56,342 --> 00:25:59,640
We don't need no thought control

161
00:25:59,681 --> 00:26:02,474
How can you have any pudding
if you don't eat your meat?

162
00:26:02,557 --> 00:26:05,809
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

163
00:26:05,852 --> 00:26:08,480
You! Yes, you, laddie!

164
00:26:08,521 --> 00:26:11,817
Poems, everybody.
The lad here reckons himself a poet.

165
00:26:11,858 --> 00:26:16,156
Teachers, leave them kids alone

166
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,874
Hey, teacher, leave those kids alone

167
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:36,051
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall

168
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:44,727
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall

169
00:27:30,945 --> 00:27:35,159
We don't need no education

170
00:27:49,466 --> 00:27:54,513
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

171
00:27:58,934 --> 00:28:03,312
Again. An acre is the area
of a rectangle...

172
00:28:03,396 --> 00:28:05,649
whose length is one furlong...

173
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:08,487
and whose width is one chain.

174
00:29:01,377 --> 00:29:04,173
Mother, do you think
they'll drop the bomb

175
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,481
Mother, do you think
they'll like the song

176
00:29:34,162 --> 00:29:38,709
Mother, do you think
they'll try to break my balls

177
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:51,639
Mother, should I build the wall

178
00:30:19,378 --> 00:30:22,258
Mother, should I run for president

179
00:30:35,688 --> 00:30:38,942
Mother, should I trust the government

180
00:30:52,581 --> 00:30:57,087
Mother, will they put me
in the firing line

181
00:31:07,222 --> 00:31:10,726
Mother, am I really dying

182
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:20,654
Hush now, baby, baby
don't you cry

183
00:31:25,158 --> 00:31:30,706
Mama's gonna make all of
your nightmares come true

184
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:36,005
Mama's gonna put
all of her fears into you

185
00:31:36,047 --> 00:31:41,258
Mama's gonna keep you
right here under her wing

186
00:31:41,342 --> 00:31:46,556
She won't let you fly
but she might let you sing

187
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:52,564
Mama's gonna keep baby cozy and warm

188
00:31:56,236 --> 00:31:59,611
Ooooh, babe

189
00:32:02,991 --> 00:32:05,577
Ooooh, babe

190
00:32:07,788 --> 00:32:13,044
Ooh, babe, of course
Mama's gonna help build the wall

191
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:54,214
Hello. Hello.
Is there anybody in there?

192
00:32:58,259 --> 00:32:59,928
Do you remember me?

193
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,263
I'm the one
from the Registry Office.

194
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:16,279
Mother, do you think
she's good enough

195
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,288
For me

196
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:33,130
And, Mother
do you think she's dangerous

197
00:33:38,803 --> 00:33:41,473
To me

198
00:33:45,853 --> 00:33:50,400
Mother, will she tear
your little boy apart

199
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:01,162
Ooooh, Ma

200
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:03,664
Mother, will she break my heart

201
00:34:10,295 --> 00:34:14,008
Hush now, baby, baby
don't you cry

202
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:24,228
Mama's gonna check out
all your girlfriends for you

203
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:29,568
Mama won't let anyone
dirty get through

204
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:34,865
Mama's gonna wait up
until you get in

205
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:40,079
Mama will always find out
where you've been

206
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:45,669
Mama's gonna keep baby
healthy and clean

207
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:53,551
Oooh, babe

208
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:58,932
Oooh, babe

209
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:06,398
Ooh, babe
You'll always be baby to me

210
00:35:19,915 --> 00:35:23,793
Mother, did it need to be so high

211
00:35:47,653 --> 00:35:49,237
- Hello?
- Yes, a collect call...

212
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,532
for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd.

213
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:54,618
Will you accept the charge
from the United States?

214
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,459
I wonder why he hung up. Is there
supposed to be someone else there...

215
00:36:02,543 --> 00:36:04,587
besides your wife, sir,
to answer?

216
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:10,719
- Hello?
- This is United States calling.

217
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,805
Are we reaching-

218
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:18,812
See, he keeps hanging up,
and it's a man answering.

219
00:38:02,341 --> 00:38:06,763
What shall we use

220
00:38:06,846 --> 00:38:09,348
To fill

221
00:38:09,431 --> 00:38:14,310
The empty spaces

222
00:38:14,394 --> 00:38:16,814
Where waves

223
00:38:16,897 --> 00:38:19,483
Of hunger

224
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:22,280
Roar

225
00:38:22,363 --> 00:38:26,243
Shall we set out across

226
00:38:26,285 --> 00:38:28,954
This sea

227
00:38:28,996 --> 00:38:32,247
Of faces

228
00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:36,294
In search of more

229
00:38:36,376 --> 00:38:41,341
And more applause

230
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:04,325
Shall we buy a new guitar

231
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:08,953
Shall we drive
a more powerful car

232
00:39:08,996 --> 00:39:13,626
Shall we work
straight through the night

233
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:15,836
Shall we get into fights

234
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,507
Leave the lights on
Drop bombs

235
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:22,929
Do tours of the East
Contract diseases

236
00:39:23,013 --> 00:39:25,349
Bury bones
Break up homes

237
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,682
Send flowers by phone

238
00:39:27,724 --> 00:39:30,019
Take to drink
Go to shrinks

239
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:32,313
Give up meat
Rarely sleep

240
00:39:32,354 --> 00:39:34,523
Keep people as pets

241
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:36,902
Train dogs
Race rats

242
00:39:36,986 --> 00:39:39,195
Fill the attic with cash

243
00:39:39,278 --> 00:39:41,198
Bury treasure
Store up leisure

244
00:39:41,281 --> 00:39:45,996
But never relax at all

245
00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:50,458
With our backs to the wall

246
00:40:24,995 --> 00:40:28,330
I am just a new boy

247
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:32,421
A stranger in this town

248
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:38,094
Where are all the good times

249
00:40:40,096 --> 00:40:44,100
Who's gonna show this stranger around

250
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,242
Ooooh

251
00:40:59,284 --> 00:41:01,243
I need a dirty woman

252
00:41:05,456 --> 00:41:09,377
Ooooh

253
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,380
I need a dirty girl

254
00:41:15,635 --> 00:41:18,305
Will some woman in this desert land

255
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,976
Make me feel like a real man

256
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,898
Take this rock and roll refugee

257
00:41:30,525 --> 00:41:33,487
Ooh, babe, set me free

258
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:49,755
Ooooh

259
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:52,215
I need a dirty woman

260
00:41:56,054 --> 00:41:59,931
Ooooh

261
00:42:00,014 --> 00:42:01,934
I need a dirty girl

262
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:55,575
Ooooh

263
00:42:55,658 --> 00:42:57,702
I need a dirty woman

264
00:43:01,707 --> 00:43:05,713
Ooooh

265
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:08,091
I need a dirty girl

266
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,292
Oh, my God.

267
00:43:42,461 --> 00:43:44,921
What a fabulous room.

268
00:43:48,841 --> 00:43:50,677
- Are all these your guitars?

269
00:44:05,194 --> 00:44:07,155
- God.

270
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:10,115
This place is bigger
than our whole apartment.

271
00:44:23,547 --> 00:44:25,926
- You like the tube, huh?

272
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:31,931
Can I get a drink of water?

273
00:44:35,143 --> 00:44:38,731
- Can I get you a drink of water?

274
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:58,085
- Oh, wow, look at this tub!

275
00:44:58,169 --> 00:45:00,589
Wanna take a bath?

276
00:45:11,098 --> 00:45:14,727
- What are you watching?

277
00:45:20,734 --> 00:45:23,570
- Hello? Hello?

278
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:32,538
- You feeling okay?

279
00:45:32,622 --> 00:45:36,334
Day after day

280
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:39,130
Love turns grey

281
00:45:39,214 --> 00:45:42,799
Like the skin of a dying man

282
00:45:46,345 --> 00:45:49,182
And night after night

283
00:45:49,266 --> 00:45:52,894
We pretend it's all right

284
00:45:52,936 --> 00:45:56,316
But I have grown older

285
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,650
And you have grown colder

286
00:45:59,733 --> 00:46:05,198
And nothing is very much fun anymore

287
00:46:06,409 --> 00:46:11,872
And I can feel

288
00:46:13,082 --> 00:46:17,004
One of my turns coming on

289
00:46:19,798 --> 00:46:22,885
I

290
00:46:22,968 --> 00:46:26,222
Feel

291
00:46:26,306 --> 00:46:29,643
Cold as a razor blade

292
00:46:29,685 --> 00:46:32,979
Tight as a tourniquet

293
00:46:33,062 --> 00:46:37,025
Dry as a funeral drum

294
00:46:41,447 --> 00:46:43,364
Run to the bedroom

295
00:46:43,448 --> 00:46:48,539
In the suitcase on the left
you'll find my favorite axe

296
00:46:52,252 --> 00:46:56,670
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase

297
00:46:56,754 --> 00:46:59,884
One of my bad days

298
00:47:02,511 --> 00:47:05,723
Would you like to watch TV

299
00:47:05,806 --> 00:47:11,355
Or get between the sheets
Or contemplate the silent freeway

300
00:47:11,438 --> 00:47:14,023
Would you like something to eat

301
00:47:14,106 --> 00:47:16,943
Would you like to learn to fly

302
00:47:18,487 --> 00:47:21,741
Would ya
Would you like to see me try

303
00:47:57,654 --> 00:48:00,324
Would you like to call the cops

304
00:48:00,408 --> 00:48:03,995
- Do you think it's time I stopped
- Next time, fuckers!

305
00:48:04,078 --> 00:48:10,042
Why are you running away

306
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,736
Oooh, babe

307
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:17,408
Don't leave me now

308
00:49:26,501 --> 00:49:28,878
How could you go

309
00:49:39,141 --> 00:49:42,477
When you know how I need you

310
00:49:51,152 --> 00:49:56,242
To beat to a pulp
on a Saturday night

311
00:49:56,325 --> 00:50:01,624
Oh, babe

312
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:04,459
Don't leave me now

313
00:50:17,641 --> 00:50:21,394
How can you treat me this way

314
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:26,984
Running away

315
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:38,080
Ooh, babe

316
00:50:39,663 --> 00:50:43,919
Why are you running away

317
00:50:43,959 --> 00:50:51,092
Oooh, babe

318
00:50:55,598 --> 00:51:02,815
Oooh, babe

319
00:51:35,766 --> 00:51:39,897
I don't need no arms around me

320
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:48,489
And I don't need
no drugs to calm me

321
00:51:53,161 --> 00:51:58,542
I have seen the writing on the wall

322
00:52:01,545 --> 00:52:06,677
Don't think I need anything at all

323
00:52:10,346 --> 00:52:12,681
No

324
00:52:12,723 --> 00:52:15,392
Don't think I need anything at all

325
00:52:23,945 --> 00:52:27,992
All and all it was all
just bricks in the wall

326
00:52:31,952 --> 00:52:36,957
All and all you were all
just bricks in the wall

327
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:11,578
Good-bye, cruel world

328
00:53:11,662 --> 00:53:14,458
I'm leaving you today

329
00:53:16,292 --> 00:53:20,840
Good-bye, good-bye

330
00:53:20,924 --> 00:53:22,842
Good-bye

331
00:53:30,935 --> 00:53:35,271
Good-bye, all you people

332
00:53:35,355 --> 00:53:39,360
There's nothing you can say

333
00:53:39,443 --> 00:53:44,533
To make me change my mind

334
00:53:44,616 --> 00:53:46,867
Good-bye

335
00:54:13,814 --> 00:54:16,192
Is there anybody out there

336
00:54:26,536 --> 00:54:28,329
Is there anybody out there

337
00:54:37,883 --> 00:54:40,676
Is there anybody out there

338
00:54:52,314 --> 00:54:55,486
Is there anybody out there

339
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:01,938
I've got a little black book
with my poems in

340
00:58:02,022 --> 00:58:06,568
Got a bag with a toothbrush
and a comb in

341
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:12,405
When I'm a good dog
they sometimes throw me a bone in

342
00:58:15,118 --> 00:58:19,623
I got elastic bands
keeping my shoes on

343
00:58:19,706 --> 00:58:24,128
Got those swollen-hand blues

344
00:58:24,212 --> 00:58:30,594
I've got 13 channels of shit
on the TV to choose from

345
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:35,974
I've got electric light

346
00:58:39,604 --> 00:58:42,273
And I've got second sight

347
00:58:42,357 --> 00:58:48,195
I've got amazing powers
of observation

348
00:58:53,284 --> 00:58:55,829
And that is how I know

349
00:58:56,997 --> 00:59:00,211
When I try to get through

350
00:59:01,961 --> 00:59:03,544
On the telephone to you

351
00:59:08,466 --> 00:59:11,471
- There'll be nobody home

352
00:59:18,604 --> 00:59:23,316
- I got the obligatory Hendrix perm

353
00:59:23,401 --> 00:59:28,448
And the inevitable pinhole burns

354
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:34,080
All down the front
of my favorite satin shirt

355
00:59:36,624 --> 00:59:41,503
I've got nicotine stains
on my fingers

356
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:46,259
I've got a silver spoon on a chain

357
00:59:46,342 --> 00:59:51,849
Got a grand piano
to prop up my mortal remains

358
00:59:54,811 --> 01:00:00,481
I got wild staring eyes

359
01:00:00,523 --> 01:00:03,445
And I got a strong urge to fly

360
01:00:06,697 --> 01:00:10,202
But I got nowhere to fly to

361
01:00:18,376 --> 01:00:23,342
Oooh, babe

362
01:00:23,425 --> 01:00:26,886
When I pick up the phone

363
01:00:30,058 --> 01:00:33,101
There's still nobody home

364
01:00:40,233 --> 01:00:44,822
I've got a pair of Gohills boots

365
01:00:44,906 --> 01:00:49,119
And I got fading roots

366
01:03:16,238 --> 01:03:22,412
Does anybody here
remember Vera Lynn

367
01:03:27,081 --> 01:03:29,793
Remember how she said

368
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:33,464
That we would meet again

369
01:03:33,548 --> 01:03:37,010
Some sunny day

370
01:04:01,246 --> 01:04:06,793
Vera

371
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:11,673
What has become of you

372
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:20,225
Does anybody else in here

373
01:04:20,309 --> 01:04:22,559
Feel the way I do

374
01:04:43,873 --> 01:04:48,004
Bring the boys back home

375
01:04:52,843 --> 01:04:57,307
Bring the boys back home

376
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:04,648
Don't leave the children

377
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:09,236
On their own, no, no

378
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:18,202
Bring the boys back home

379
01:05:22,874 --> 01:05:27,214
Bring the boys back home

380
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,973
Don't leave the children

381
01:05:35,387 --> 01:05:39,934
On their own, no, no

382
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:48,445
Bring the boys back home

383
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:54,200
- Bad! Do it again!

384
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,630
- You feeling okay?

385
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:17,392
Is there anybody out there

386
01:06:17,434 --> 01:06:19,644
- Fuck me.

387
01:06:19,728 --> 01:06:22,941
He's gone completely around
the bleedin' twist.

388
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:25,903
You vicious bastard,
you never did like me, did you?

389
01:06:27,322 --> 01:06:29,574
Hello

390
01:06:29,616 --> 01:06:32,116
Is there anybody in there

391
01:06:33,701 --> 01:06:38,165
Just nod if you can hear me

392
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:40,502
Is there anyone at home

393
01:06:42,462 --> 01:06:45,674
Come on, now

394
01:06:45,758 --> 01:06:49,968
I hear you're feeling down

395
01:06:50,052 --> 01:06:52,847
Well, I can ease your pain

396
01:06:52,931 --> 01:06:57,436
- And get you on your feet again
- The boy's an asthmatic.

397
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,482
- Asthmatic!?
- Relax

398
01:07:00,565 --> 01:07:05,070
- I'll need some information first
- He's an artist!

399
01:07:05,153 --> 01:07:08,450
Just the basic facts

400
01:07:08,531 --> 01:07:12,828
Can you show me where it hurts

401
01:07:12,911 --> 01:07:17,792
There is no pain
you are receding

402
01:07:20,879 --> 01:07:25,260
A distant ship smoke
on the horizon

403
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:32,765
You are only coming through in waves

404
01:07:35,353 --> 01:07:37,313
Your lips move

405
01:07:37,355 --> 01:07:40,233
But I can't hear what you're saying

406
01:07:43,028 --> 01:07:45,904
When I was a child

407
01:07:45,988 --> 01:07:48,324
I had a fever

408
01:07:50,536 --> 01:07:56,376
My hands felt just like two balloons

409
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:03,009
Now I've got that feeling once again

410
01:08:03,092 --> 01:08:07,219
I can't explain
you would not understand

411
01:08:07,303 --> 01:08:10,849
This is not how I am

412
01:08:13,644 --> 01:08:18,275
I

413
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:21,780
Have become comfortably numb

414
01:08:55,274 --> 01:09:00,239
I

415
01:09:00,322 --> 01:09:03,113
Have become comfortably numb

416
01:09:06,868 --> 01:09:09,371
Okay

417
01:09:09,454 --> 01:09:11,708
Just a little pinprick

418
01:09:13,292 --> 01:09:17,214
There'll be no more
Aaaaah

419
01:09:17,298 --> 01:09:20,049
But you may feel a little sick

420
01:09:21,301 --> 01:09:24,554
Can you stand up

421
01:09:24,637 --> 01:09:27,057
I do believe it's working

422
01:09:27,141 --> 01:09:28,351
- Good
- He's coming around.

423
01:09:28,435 --> 01:09:33,356
- That'll keep you going through the show
- There, you see?

424
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,027
- Come on, it's time to go
- How do you feel?

425
01:09:37,111 --> 01:09:42,199
There is no pain
you are receding

426
01:09:45,077 --> 01:09:49,374
A distant ship smoke
on the horizon

427
01:09:52,419 --> 01:09:56,714
You are only coming through in waves

428
01:09:59,508 --> 01:10:01,427
Your lips move

429
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:04,473
But I can't hear what you're saying

430
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:10,064
When I was a child

431
01:10:10,146 --> 01:10:12,858
I caught a fleeting glimpse

432
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:19,741
Out of the corner of my eye

433
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:26,789
I turned to look
but it was gone

434
01:10:26,872 --> 01:10:31,586
I cannot put my finger on it now

435
01:10:31,669 --> 01:10:35,799
The child is grown
The dream is gone

436
01:10:37,717 --> 01:10:42,348
I

437
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:47,021
Have become comfortably numb

438
01:14:24,256 --> 01:14:27,259
So ya thought ya

439
01:14:27,343 --> 01:14:30,389
Might like to go to the show

440
01:14:33,933 --> 01:14:37,603
To feel the warm thrill
of confusion

441
01:14:37,685 --> 01:14:40,564
That space cadet glow

442
01:14:43,777 --> 01:14:48,117
I got some bad news for you, sunshine

443
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:52,247
Pink isn't well
He's, uh, back at the hotel

444
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:55,372
And they sent us along
as a surrogate band

445
01:14:55,455 --> 01:14:59,836
Now tonight, we 're gonna find out
where you fans really stand

446
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:05,801
Are there any queers
in the audience tonight

447
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:12,100
- Get 'em up against the wall
- Against the wall

448
01:15:12,183 --> 01:15:15,353
There's one in the spotlight
he don't look right

449
01:15:17,604 --> 01:15:22,111
- Have him up against the wall
- Against the wall

450
01:15:22,193 --> 01:15:26,575
And that one looks Jewish
And that one's a coon

451
01:15:26,658 --> 01:15:30,203
Who let all this riffraff
into the room

452
01:15:30,287 --> 01:15:32,454
There's one smoking a joint

453
01:15:32,538 --> 01:15:36,667
And that one's got spots

454
01:15:36,751 --> 01:15:40,881
If I had my way
I'd have all of you shot

455
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:24,409
Run, run, run, run

456
01:17:27,955 --> 01:17:32,001
You better make your face up
in your favorite disguise

457
01:17:32,084 --> 01:17:36,549
With your button-down lips
and your roller-blind eyes

458
01:17:36,632 --> 01:17:40,679
With your empty smile
and your hungry heart

459
01:17:40,762 --> 01:17:44,598
Feel the bile rising
from your guilty past

460
01:17:44,681 --> 01:17:48,811
With your nerves in tatters
as the cockleshell shatters

461
01:17:48,853 --> 01:17:52,650
And the hammers batter down your door

462
01:17:52,692 --> 01:17:57,447
You better run
run, run, run

463
01:17:57,530 --> 01:18:05,621
Run, run, run, run

464
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:13,255
You better run all day
and run all night

465
01:18:13,339 --> 01:18:17,301
Keep your dirty feelings deep inside

466
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:21,387
And if you're taking
your girlfriend out tonight

467
01:18:21,472 --> 01:18:25,810
You'd better park the car
well out of sight

468
01:18:25,893 --> 01:18:29,731
'Cause if they catch you in
the back seat trying to pick her locks

469
01:18:29,815 --> 01:18:33,820
They're gonna send you back to Mother
in a cardboard box

470
01:18:33,904 --> 01:18:35,823
You better run

471
01:19:07,814 --> 01:19:10,152
You cannot reach me now

472
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:18,074
No matter how you try

473
01:19:19,409 --> 01:19:22,289
Good-bye, cruel world

474
01:19:22,372 --> 01:19:24,875
It's over

475
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:26,836
Walk on by

476
01:19:31,258 --> 01:19:33,218
Waiting

477
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:36,386
- To cut out the dead wood
- Waiting

478
01:19:36,428 --> 01:19:39,765
- To weed out the weaklings
- Waiting

479
01:19:39,848 --> 01:19:43,520
To smash in their windows
and kick in their doors

480
01:19:43,604 --> 01:19:48,025
- Waiting
- For the final solution to strengthen the strain

481
01:19:48,108 --> 01:19:51,780
- Waiting
- To follow the worms

482
01:19:55,073 --> 01:19:58,369
- Would you like to see
- Would you like to see

483
01:19:58,453 --> 01:20:01,790
Britannia rule again

484
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:05,377
My friend

485
01:20:08,172 --> 01:20:13,094
All you need to do
is follow the worms

486
01:20:56,392 --> 01:21:05,819
Hammer! Hammer!

487
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:23,630
Hammer! Hammer! Hammer!

488
01:21:23,714 --> 01:21:26,591
Stop!

489
01:23:17,379 --> 01:23:19,006
Stop.

490
01:23:25,302 --> 01:23:27,221
I wanna go home

491
01:23:31,184 --> 01:23:36,149
Take off this uniform
and leave the show

492
01:23:38,776 --> 01:23:42,906
But I'm waiting in this cell

493
01:23:42,989 --> 01:23:46,201
Because I have to know

494
01:23:47,744 --> 01:23:51,208
Have I been

495
01:23:51,249 --> 01:23:56,711
Have I been guilty all this time

496
01:24:47,434 --> 01:24:50,354
Good morning, Worm, Your Honor

497
01:24:50,438 --> 01:24:52,772
The crown will plainly show

498
01:24:52,856 --> 01:24:56,651
The prisoner who now stands before you

499
01:24:56,734 --> 01:25:01,616
Was caught red-handed showing feelings

500
01:25:01,658 --> 01:25:07,207
Showing feelings
of an almost human nature

501
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:11,041
This will not do

502
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:13,337
Call the schoolmaster

503
01:25:13,421 --> 01:25:16,381
I always said he'd come to no good

504
01:25:16,465 --> 01:25:18,926
In the end, Your Honor

505
01:25:18,968 --> 01:25:21,429
If they'd let me have my way

506
01:25:21,512 --> 01:25:25,768
I could have flayed him into shape

507
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:28,729
But my hands were tied

508
01:25:28,813 --> 01:25:31,190
The bleeding hearts and artists

509
01:25:31,273 --> 01:25:34,651
Let him get away with murder

510
01:25:34,735 --> 01:25:37,864
Let me hammer him today

511
01:25:40,283 --> 01:25:43,663
Crazy

512
01:25:43,703 --> 01:25:49,750
Toys in the attic
I am crazy

513
01:25:49,834 --> 01:25:53,005
Truly gone fishing

514
01:25:56,843 --> 01:26:02,767
They must have taken my marbles away

515
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:06,187
Crazy

516
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:12,526
Toys in the attic
He is crazy

517
01:26:17,032 --> 01:26:20,034
You little shit
You're in it now

518
01:26:20,118 --> 01:26:23,372
I hope they throw away the key

519
01:26:23,413 --> 01:26:27,709
You should've talked to me
more often than you did

520
01:26:27,751 --> 01:26:31,422
But no
You had to go your own way

521
01:26:31,506 --> 01:26:34,925
Have you broken
any homes up lately

522
01:26:35,009 --> 01:26:38,264
Just five minutes, Worm, Your Honor

523
01:26:38,347 --> 01:26:41,267
Him and me alone

524
01:26:42,853 --> 01:26:48,983
Babe

525
01:26:49,066 --> 01:26:51,277
Come to Mother, baby

526
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:55,115
Let me hold you in my arms

527
01:26:55,199 --> 01:27:00,705
M'lud, I never wanted him
to get in any trouble

528
01:27:00,746 --> 01:27:03,999
Why'd he ever have to leave me

529
01:27:04,082 --> 01:27:08,085
Worm, Your Honor
let me take him home

530
01:27:09,754 --> 01:27:12,885
Crazy

531
01:27:12,967 --> 01:27:19,391
Over the rainbow
I'm crazy

532
01:27:19,433 --> 01:27:22,811
Bars in the window

533
01:27:25,647 --> 01:27:30,736
There must have been a door there
in the wall

534
01:27:30,819 --> 01:27:35,700
- When I came in
- Crazy

535
01:27:35,784 --> 01:27:41,873
Over the rainbow
He is crazy

536
01:27:45,795 --> 01:27:51,968
The evidence before the court
is incontrovertible

537
01:27:52,053 --> 01:27:56,141
There's no need
for the jury to retire

538
01:27:58,392 --> 01:28:01,019
In all my years of judging

539
01:28:01,102 --> 01:28:04,313
I have never heard before

540
01:28:04,396 --> 01:28:06,984
Of someone more deserving

541
01:28:07,068 --> 01:28:11,030
The full penalty of law

542
01:28:11,113 --> 01:28:13,534
The way you made them suffer

543
01:28:13,617 --> 01:28:17,330
Your exquisite wife and mother

544
01:28:17,372 --> 01:28:20,790
Fills me with the urge to defecate

545
01:28:23,586 --> 01:28:29,300
Since, my friend
you have revealed your deepest fear

546
01:28:29,342 --> 01:28:33,179
I sentence you to be exposed

547
01:28:33,221 --> 01:28:36,268
Before your peers

548
01:28:36,348 --> 01:28:45,609
Tear down the wall

549
01:31:45,388 --> 01:31:47,891
All alone

550
01:31:47,932 --> 01:31:49,893
Or in two's

551
01:31:51,646 --> 01:31:55,691
The ones who really love you

552
01:31:59,696 --> 01:32:02,615
Walk up and down

553
01:32:02,699 --> 01:32:04,617
Outside the wall

554
01:32:10,414 --> 01:32:14,380
Some hand in hand

555
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:20,593
Some gathered together in bands

556
01:32:23,136 --> 01:32:28,435
The bleeding hearts
and the artists

557
01:32:28,477 --> 01:32:30,437
Make their stand

558
01:32:34,234 --> 01:32:39,613
And when they've given you their all

559
01:32:39,697 --> 01:32:42,535
Some stagger and fall

560
01:32:42,618 --> 01:32:46,037
After all, it's not easy

561
01:32:48,291 --> 01:32:50,792
Banging your heart

562
01:32:50,876 --> 01:32:55,423
Against some mad bugger's wall

563
01:34:13,674 --> 01:34:18,846
When they've given you their all

564
01:34:18,888 --> 01:34:21,517
Some stagger and fall

565
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,979
After all, it's not easy
